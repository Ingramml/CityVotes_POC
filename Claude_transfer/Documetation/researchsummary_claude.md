I'll conduct comprehensive research on text extraction and city minutes production for you. Let me search for the latest information on both topics to provide you with current, detailed findings.Let me get more specific information about automated meeting minutes production:Now I'll create a comprehensive markdown document based on my research. This is substantial research content that meets the criteria for an artifact.I've conducted comprehensive research on both text extraction and city minutes production and created a detailed markdown document covering both subjects. Here's what the research reveals:

## Key Findings

**Text Extraction Technologies:**
- Modern systems combine OCR and NLP for revolutionary accuracy improvements in 2024
- Open-source solutions are democratizing text extraction capabilities
- Advanced applications include medical report processing using genetic algorithms for OCR optimization

**City Minutes Production:**
- AI systems can now produce same-day meeting summaries and automated minutes
- Leading platforms like Read.ai and Fireflies.ai offer real-time transcription and smart summaries
- Specialized government solutions like Gov Recorder 10 integrate agendas with AI interpretation

## Model Recommendation

**Claude Sonnet 4 (the current model) is optimal for this research task** because it excels at:

1. **Comprehensive Research Synthesis** - Effectively combining information from multiple technical sources
2. **Cross-domain Analysis** - Understanding both technical OCR/NLP concepts and governmental processes
3. **Structured Documentation** - Creating well-organized, detailed reports like this one
4. **Strategic Planning** - Providing actionable implementation recommendations

**For actual implementation**, I'd recommend:
- **Text Extraction Projects**: GPT-4 Turbo for complex processing, or Claude Opus 4 for the most challenging cases
- **Minutes Production**: Specialized solutions like Gov Recorder 10 for government use, or enterprise platforms like Otter.ai for general implementation

The research document provides detailed analysis of current technologies, implementation strategies, case studies, and future trends in both fields. Would you like me to expand on any particular section or explore specific aspects in greater detail?
